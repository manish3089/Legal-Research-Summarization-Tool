                  ``CHAPTER 172--CONSTITUTIONAL TORTS

``Sec. 2691. Definitions
    ``As used in this chapter and sections 1346(b)(2) and 2401(b)(2)--
            ``(1) the term `Federal agency' includes any executive 
        department, military department, independent establishment of 
        the United States, any person or entity acting as an 
        instrumentality or agent of the United States, any contractor 
        with the United States, any other establishment of the United 
        States (including the Executive Office of the President), and 
        any party acting in concert with the United States;
            ``(2) the term `employee of the Government' includes 
        officers and employees in the executive branch of the Federal 
        Government, members of the military or naval forces of the 
        United States, members of the National Guard while engaged in 
        training or duty under section 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 of 
        title 32, and any person acting on behalf of or in concert with 
        a Federal agency, temporarily or permanently in the service of 
        the United States, whether with or without compensation, and 
        whose acts or omissions are done with the knowledge or consent 
        of the United States; and
            ``(3) the term `constitutional tort' means a violation of 
        the Constitution of the United States or violation of human 
        rights resulting from or caused by the act or omission of a 
        Federal agency or an employee of the Government while acting 
        within the scope of the employee's office, employment, or 
        apparent authority, or which results from the negligent 
        supervision of an employee of the Government. Administrative adjustment of claims
    ``(a) The head of each Federal agency may, in accordance with 
regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, compromise and settle 
any claim for money damages based on a constitutional tort, except that 
any award, compromise, or settlement in excess of $25,000 shall be 
effected only with the prior written approval of the Attorney General. The acceptance by a claimant of any award, compromise, or 
settlement made under this section or section 2697 shall be final and 
conclusive on the claimant, and shall constitute a complete release of 
any claim against the United States and against the employee of the 
Government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, by reason of 
the same subject matter. Disposition by Federal agency as prerequisite; evidence
    ``(a) An action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the 
United States for money damages based on a constitutional tort unless 
the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate 
Federal agency and that claim shall have been finally denied by the 
agency in writing and sent to the claimant by certified or registered 
mail. Except as to a class action claim or if damages are not fully 
ascertainable at the time of presentation pursuant to subsection (a), 
an action under this section shall not be instituted for any sum in 
excess of the amount of the claim presented to the Federal agency, 
except where the increased amount is based upon newly discovered 
evidence not reasonably discoverable at the time of presenting the 
claim to the Federal agency or upon allegation and proof of intervening 
facts, relating to the amount of the claim. Judgment as bar
    ``The judgment in an action under section 1346(b)(2) shall 
constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant involved, by 
reason of the same constitutional violation against the employee of the 
Government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, but shall not 
act as a release on any claim for violation of any other law. Exclusiveness of remedy
    ``(a) The authority of any Federal agency to sue and be sued in its 
own name shall not be construed to authorize suits against such Federal 
agency on constitutional tort claims arising under this chapter which 
are cognizable under section 1346(b)(2), and the remedies provided by 
this title in such case shall be exclusive. Upon filing a claim with the district court under section 
1346(b)(2), the remedy against the United States provided by section 
2693 for claims for money damages based on constitutional torts shall 
be exclusive of any other Federal civil action or proceeding for money 
damages by reason of the same subject matter against the employee whose 
act or omission gave rise to the claim or against the estate of such 
employee. ``(2) Paragraph (1) does not extend or apply to a civil action 
against an employee of the Government--
            ``(A) which is brought against the employee for acting 
        outside the scope of the employee's office or employment in 
        violation of the Constitution of the United States, or
            ``(B) which is brought for a violation of a statute of the 
        United States or a statute of any State under which such action 
        against an individual is otherwise authorized. ``(d) Upon certification by the Attorney General pursuant to 
subsection (e), the Attorney General shall defend any civil action or 
proceeding brought in any court against any employee of the Government 
or against the estate of such employee for money damages based on any 
constitutional tort. The employee against whom such civil action or 
proceeding is brought shall deliver within such time after date of 
service or knowledge of service as determined by the Attorney General, 
all process served upon the employee or an attested true copy thereof 
to the employee's immediate superior or to whomever was designated by 
the head of the employee's department to receive such papers and such 
person shall promptly furnish copies of the pleadings and process 
therein to the United States attorney for the district embracing the 
place wherein the proceeding is brought, to the Attorney General, and 
to the head of the employee's employing Federal agency. Upon certification by the Attorney General that the 
defendant was acting within the scope of the defendant's office or 
employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, 
any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a United 
States district court shall be deemed an action against the United 
States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, 
and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant. ``(2) Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant 
was acting within the scope of the defendant's office or employment at 
the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action 
or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be 
removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General 
to the district court of the United States for the district and 
division embracing the place in which the action or proceeding is 
pending. Such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or 
proceeding brought against the United States under the provisions of 
this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be 
substituted as the party defendant. Upon such certification by the court, such action or 
proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought 
against the United States under the provisions of this title and all 
references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the 
party defendant. ``(4) Upon certification, any action or proceeding subject to 
paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall proceed in the same manner as any 
action against the United States filed pursuant to section 1346(b)(2) 
and shall be subject to the limitations and exceptions applicable to 
those actions. ``(5) Whenever an action or proceeding in which the United States 
is substituted as the party defendant under this subsection is 
dismissed for failure to first present a claim pursuant to section 
2694(a), such a claim shall be deemed to be timely presented under 
section 2401(b)(2) if--
            ``(A) the claim would have been timely had it been filed on 
        the date the underlying civil action was commenced, and
            ``(B) the claim is presented to the appropriate Federal 
        agency within 60 days after dismissal of the civil action. ``(f) The Attorney General may compromise or settle any claim 
asserted in any civil action or proceeding described in this section in 
the manner provided in section 2697, and with the same effect. Administrative action concerning employee
    ``Where an action or proceeding under section 1346(b)(2) or 2692 on 
a constitutional tort results in a judgment against the United States 
or an award, compromise, or settlement paid by the United States, the 
Attorney General shall forward the matter to the head of the Federal 
agency which employed the employee at the time of the employee's 
alleged act or omission giving rise to the claim upon which the action 
or proceeding was based, for such further administrative investigation 
or disciplinary action as may be appropriate. (a) Section 2401.--Section 2401(b) of title 28, United States Code, 
concerning the statute of limitations, is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(1)'' immediately after ``(b)'';

        out of unlawful human experimentation within the meaning of 
        section 2681 shall not be barred if presented in writing to the 
        appropriate Federal agency within 3 years from the date of the 
        enactment of section 2681.''; and
            (4) by adding after paragraph (1) the following:
    ``(2) A claim for money damages based on a constitutional tort 
against the United States cognizable under section 1346(b)(2) of 
chapter 172 shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing 
to the appropriate Federal agency within 2 years after such claim 
accrues or unless action is begun within 6 months after the date of 
mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of 
the claim by the agency to which it was presented, except that any 
claim accruing prior to enactment of chapter 172 shall not be barred if 
presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within 3 years 
from the date of enactment of chapter 172.''. (b) Section 2402.--Section 2402 of title 28, United States Code, is 
amended by inserting ``or 1346(b)(2)'' after ``1346(a)(1)''. (c) Section 2674.--Section 2674 of title 28, United States Code, is

SEC. (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
            (1) the term ``implementation bill'' means only a bill 
        which is introduced as provided under subsection (b), and 
        contains the proposed legislation contained in the final report 
        submitted to the Congress under section 4(c) (2) or (4) without 
        modification; and
            (2) the term ``session day'' means a day that both the 
        Senate and the House of Representatives are in session. On the first session day on or 
immediately following the date on which a final report is submitted to 
the Congress under section 4(c) (2) or (4), an implementation bill 
shall be introduced--
            (A) in the Senate by the Majority Leader of the Senate, for 
        himself, the Minority Leader of the Senate, or by Members of 
        the Senate designated by the Majority Leader and Minority 
        Leader of the Senate; and
            (B) in the House of Representatives by the Majority Leader 
        of the House of Representatives, for himself and the Minority 
        Leader of the House of Representatives, or by Members of the 
        House of Representatives designated by the Majority Leader and 
        Minority Leader of the House of Representatives. The implementation bill 
introduced in the House of Representatives shall be referred 
concurrently to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of 
Representatives, and other committees with jurisdiction. (c) Discharge.--If the committee to which an implementation bill is 
referred has not reported such bill by the end of the 15 session day 
period beginning on the date of introduction of such bill, such 
committee shall be, at the end of such period, discharged from further 
consideration of such bill, and such bill shall be placed on the 
appropriate calendar of the House involved. On or after the fifth session day after the 
date on which the committee to which such a bill is referred has 
reported, or has been discharged (under subsection (c)) from further 
consideration of, such a bill, it is in order (even though a previous 
motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the 
respective House to move to proceed to the consideration of the 
implementation bill (but only on the day after the calendar day on 
which such Member announces to the House concerned the Member's 
intention to do so). If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the 
implementation bill is agreed to, the respective House shall 
immediately proceed to consideration of the implementation bill without 
intervening motion, order, or other business, and the implementation 
bill shall remain the unfinished business of the respective House until 
disposed of.
    (2) Debate on the implementation bill, and on all debatable motions 
and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 
10 hours, which shall be divided equally between the Majority Leader 
and the Minority Leader or their designees. If, before the passage by 
one House of an implementation bill of that House described in 
subsection (a), that House receives from the other House an 
implementation bill described in subsection (a), then the following 
procedures shall apply:
            (A). The implementation bill of the other House shall not be 
        referred to a committee and may not be considered in the House 
        receiving it except in the case of final passage as provided in 
        subparagraph (B)(ii). With respect to an implementation bill described in 
        subsection (a) of the House receiving such bill--
                    (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same 
                as if no implementation bill had been received from the 
                other House; but
                    (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the 
                implementation bill of the other House, except that if 
                the implementation bill is a bill for the raising of 
                revenue, the vote of final passage shall be upon the 
                implementation bill which originates in the House of 
                Representatives. (2) Upon disposition of the implementation bill received from the 
other House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the 
implementation bill that originated in the receiving House. (f) Rules of the Senate and House.--This section is enacted by 
Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of an implementation bill described in 
        subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the 
        extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.

SEC. Any proceeds from the sale of assets of any department or agency 
resulting from the enactment of an Act under section 5 shall be--
            (1) applied to reduce the Federal deficit; and
            (2) deposited in the Treasury and treated as general 
        receipts.

SEC. there should be 
        appropriated to each agency an amount no less than 25 percent 
        of the amount of the estimate of administrative savings 
        determined under section 4(a)(2) applicable to such agency in 
        the 3 fiscal years following the submission of the 
        recommendation; and
            (2) the appropriated amount described under paragraph (1) 
        should be--
                    (A) appropriated funds in addition to funds which 
                would otherwise be appropriated to such agency if not 
                for the provisions of this Act; and
                    (B) made available for expenditure at the 
                discretion of the head of such agency to improve such 
                agency's management, efficiency, or productivity."

        112 (42 U.S.C. 7412) with the exception of section 112(r), 
        section 129 (42 U.S.C. 7429), Section 165 (42 U.S.C. 7475), 
        subsections (e) and (f) of section 183 (42 U.S.C. 7511b), 
        section 328 (42 U.S.C. 7627), title IV or title VI (unless the 
        permitting authority determines that a requirement imposed 
        pursuant to title VI need not be contained in a permit issued 
        under this title) and any limitation on emissions or operations 
        contained in a construction permit issued pursuant to Parts C 
        or D of title I. The term `applicable requirement' also 
        includes any other requirement provided for in an applicable 
        state implementation plan, except that a requirement imposed 
        pursuant to a State minor new source review program under

(42 U.S.C. 766la(b)(10)), is amended to read as follows:
            ``(10). Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude any State from continuing to 
impose any requirement or employ any procedure separate and apart from

title.''. A provision giving major stationary sources the 
        option of obtaining permits that would allow emissions 
        increases and decreases at various units within the major 
        stationary source without permit revisions if overall emissions

        Administrator to increase the stringency of controls or to 
        impose new controls, as required under any other section of 
        this Act. Section 302 (42 U.S.C. 7602) is amended by adding the following at

operational limit on the capacity of a source to emit any regulated air 
pollutant, including any limit enforceable under Federal, State, or 
local law and including any pollution control equipment and 
restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material 
used, produced, stored, combusted or processed at such source shall be 
treated as part of its design if the limitation is effective.''. The first sentence of section 179(a) (42 U.S.C. 7509(a)) is amended 
by striking ``one of the sanctions referred to in subsection (b) shall

standard by the applicable attainment date.''. Section 112(j)(6) is amended in the second sentence by striking all 
after ``the Administrator shall revise such permit'' and inserting ``to 
comply with such standard and such revision shall take effect on the 
date 10 years after the date such standard is promulgated.''. Section 182(b)(1)(C) is amended by adding the following at the end 
thereof: ``Any measures that were not expressly required by this Act, 
but that were voluntarily implemented, prior to the designation of the

for purposes of any revised plan adopted for the area pursuant to this 
part following designation of the area as an ozone nonattainment 
area.''. SEC. 8. (a) Paragraph (5) Extensions.--Section 181(a)(5)(B) is amended to

Federal Register of the Administrator's proposed approval or denial of 
such request within 90 days after receipt of a complete State 
redesignation request or fails to approve or deny such request within

revision submitted under this Act are adequate to attain and maintain 
any national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard, the 
Administrator shall provide appropriate credits for plan provisions 
which are designed to control air pollution only during certain periods 
when levels of one or more air pollutants are, or are likely to be, at 
higher levels than at other periods.''. Section 211(k)(6)(A) of the Clean Air Act is amended as follows:

        public health. The revised 
        national primary ambient air quality standards promulgated 
        under subsection (a)(3) shall be as close to such national 
        primary ambient air quality goals as feasible such that the

    ``(d) Overwhelming Transport.--If, based on photochemical grid 
modeling demonstrations or any other analytical method determined by 
the Administrator to be as effective, the Administrator determines that 
the area is a downwind nonattainment area receiving ozone or ozone 
precursor transport from outside the area and control of ozone 
concentrations is beyond the ability of the area to control because 
volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen from sources within 
such area do not make a significant contribution to ozone 
concentrations in such area (or in any other ozone nonattainment area), 
the Administrator may redesignate the area as attainment or as having a 
lower classification.''. SEC. Section 182(c)(3)(C)(iv) is amended by inserting ``safety 
inspection approval or'' after ``denial of''. Section 110 is amended by inserting the following new subsection 
immediately before subsection (f):

any emissions trading program submitted under this section as part of 
an applicable implementation plan or implementation plan revision for 
any area unless the Administrator determines that such program would 
result in the failure of a nonattainment area to attain the national 
primary or secondary ambient air quality standards by the applicable 
attainment date or in the failure of an area that has been designated 
as attainment to maintain such standards. The Administrator shall not 
be required to approve any plan which will result in increased 
emissions (beyond the maintenance plan level) of the criteria pollutant 
for which the area is classified as nonattainment.''."

              EMPLOYEES WHO SERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY IN A RESERVE COMPONENT 
              OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES. (a) In General.--Chapter 17 of title 37, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 911. Assistance for State and local governments that continue to 
              pay employees who serve on active duty
    ``(a) Continuation of Civilian Basic Pay.--It is the purpose of 
this section to encourage States and local governments to continue to 
pay a portion of the civilian compensation of those employees who are 
also members of a reserve component and are absent from a position of 
employment with the State or local government under a call or order to 
serve on active duty for a period of more than 30 days so that the 
employees receive compensation in an amount that, when taken together 
with their military pay, is at least equal to their civilian 
compensation. At the request of a State or 
local government that continues to pay all or a portion of the civilian 
compensation of an employee described in subsection (a), the Secretary 
concerned shall reimburse the State or local government for 50 percent 
of the civilian compensation paid by the State or local government for 
each pay period described in subsection (c), but not to exceed 50 
percent of the difference (if any) between--
            ``(A) the amount of civilian compensation that would 
        otherwise have been payable to the employee for such pay period 
        if the employee's civilian employment with the State or local 
        government had not been interrupted by the service on active 
        duty; and
            ``(B) the amount of military pay that is payable to the 
        employee for the service on active duty and is allocable to 
        such pay period. ``(2) If the pay periods described in subsection (c) extend more 
than nine consecutive months after the first day of the first month 
during which the employee began to serve on active duty for a period of 
more than 30 days, the reimbursement rate shall become 100 percent for 
the subsequent payments. However, as is the case under paragraph (1), 
reimbursement shall be provided only for the difference (if any) 
between--
            ``(A) the amount of civilian compensation that would 
        otherwise have been payable to the employee for such pay period 
        if the employee's civilian employment with the State or local 
        government had not been interrupted by the service on active 
        duty; and
            ``(B) the amount of military pay that is payable to the 
        employee for the service on active duty and is allocable to 
        such pay period. ``(c) Pay Periods.--Reimbursement shall be provided under this 
section with respect to each pay period (which would otherwise apply if 
the employee's civilian employment had not been interrupted) that 
occurs--
            ``(1) while the employee serves on active duty for a period 
        of more than 30 days;
            ``(2) while the employee is hospitalized for, or 
        convalescing from, an illness or injury incurred in, or 
        aggravated during, the performance of such active duty; or
            ``(3) during the 14-day period beginning at the end of such 
        active duty or the end of the period referred to in 
        subparagraph (B). If an 
employee described in subsection (a), with respect to whom 
reimbursement is provided to a State or local government under this 
section, fails to report or apply for employment or reemployment with 
the State or local government by the end of the period referred to in 
subsection (c)(3), the employee shall refund to the Secretary concerned 
the total amount of the reimbursement provided with respect to the 
employee. (c) Application of Amendment.--Section 911 of title 37, United 
States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall apply with respect to 
pay periods (as described in subsection (b) of such section) beginning 
on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.

employee was absent from employment for a reason described in 
subsection (b). ``(c) Covered Pay Periods.--Subsection (a) shall apply with respect

        active duty or the end of the period referred to in paragraph 
        (2). ``(e) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
            ``(1) The terms `active duty for a period of more than 30 
        days', `member', and `reserve component' have the meanings

        is introduced as provided under subsection (b), and contains 
        the proposed legislative recommendations contained in the final

4(e), an implementing bill shall be introduced--
            (1) in the Senate by the majority leader for himself and 
        the minority leader; and
            (2) in the House of Representatives by the majority leader 
        for himself and the minority leader. On or after the first day after the date 
on which the committee to which an implementing bill is referred has 
reported, or has been discharged (under subsection (c)) from further 
consideration of, such a bill, it is in order (even though a previous 
motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any member of the 
House of Representatives or the Senate, respectively, to move to 
proceed to the consideration of the bill (but only the day after the 
calendar day on which the member announces to the House concerned the 
member's intention to do so). (iv) If a motion described in clause (i) is agreed to, the House of 
Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be, shall immediately 
proceed to consideration of the bill without intervening motion, order, 
or other business, and the bill shall remain the unfinished business of 
the House of Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be, until 
disposed of.

and appeals in connection therewith shall be limited to not more than 4 
hours in the House of Representatives and 10 hours in the Senate, which 
shall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the 
bill. If, before the passage by 
one House of an implementing bill that was introduced in that House, 
that House receives from the other House an implementing bill--
            (A) the bill of the other House shall not be referred to a 
        committee and may not be considered in the House that receives 
        it otherwise than on final passage under subparagraph (B)(ii); 
        and
            (B)(i) the procedure in the House that receives such a bill 
        with respect to such a bill that was introduced in that House 
        shall be the same as if no bill had been received from the 
        other House; but
            (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the bill of the 
        other House. (2) Upon disposition of an implementing bill that is received by 
one House from the other House, it shall no longer be in order to 
consider such a bill that was introduced in the receiving House. (f) Date Certain.--If the Senate and the House of Representatives 
have not acted upon the implementing bill by July 20th, then on that 
day or the next day of session thereafter the bill shall be called up 
by the Presiding Officer of each House upon convening and a roll call 
vote shall be conducted on passage, but after that House of Congress 
has debated the bill pursuant to the provisions of subsections 
(d)(2)(A) and (C). If the bill passes one House, the bill shall be 
transmitted on the same legislative day to the other House and that 
House shall vote on passage of that bill on its next session day. (g) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House of 
Representatives or the Senate to consider any implementing bill that is 
not in full compliance with the growth limitation provision of section 
4(a)(1) or that contains any provision that increases taxes. (h) Rules of the Senate and House of Representatives.--This section 
is enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed to be 
        part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable 
        only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House 
        in the case of an implementing bill, and it supersedes other 
        rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with such 
        rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.

Comptroller General shall submit to the Congress and the President a 
report stating whether the requirements of this Act have been complied

management and protection of old growth Redwood forest areas in 
Humboldt County, California, and to preserve and enhance habitat for 
the marbled murrelet, Northern Spotted owl, native salmon stocks, and 
other old growth forest dependent species, by adding certain lands and 
waters to the Six Rivers National Forest and by including a portion of 
such lands in the national wilderness preservation system. (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:
            (1) The terms ``Six Rivers National Forest Addition'' and 
        ``Headwaters Forest'' mean the area authorized for land

        tract of land proposed to be acquired is only partly within the 
        Six Rivers National Forest Addition, the Secretary may acquire 
        all or any portion of the land outside of the Six Rivers 
        National Forest Addition to minimize the payment of severance 
        costs. (5) Special rule for state or local government lands.--
        Lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the Six

shall also be administered in accordance with the provisions of the 
Wilderness Act governing areas designated by that Act as wilderness, 
except that any reference in such provisions to the effective date of 
the Wilderness Act (or any similar reference) shall be deemed to be a

State of California in an amount equal to the State of California 
Timber Yield Tax revenues payable under the California Revenue and 
Taxation Code (sec. 38101 et seq.). in effect as of the date of 
enactment of this Act that would have been paid with respect to such 
lands if the lands had not been acquired by the United States, as

        copayments and Government cost-sharing;

        care insurance program for veterans described in subsection (b) 
        using contract authority (if such contract authority is 
        provided by law); and

eligible to enroll in the VA Group Health Plan, there shall be an 
initial enrollment period (of not less than 30 days) during which the 
veteran may enroll in the plan. ``(3) The Secretary shall establish an annual period, of not less 
than 30 days, during which eligible veterans may enroll in the VA Group 
Health Plan. ``(4) If a veteran enrolls in the VA Group Health Plan, the veteran

spouse and children in the plan. Limitation on preexisting conditions
    ``(a) The VA Group Health Plan may not impose (and an insurer under 
that plan may not require the Secretary impose through a waiting period 
for coverage under the plan or similar requirement) a limitation or 
exclusion of benefits relating to treatment of a condition based on the 
fact that the condition preexisted the effective date of the plan with 
respect to an individual if--

covered under the plan as of the earliest date of the beginning of the 
waiting period. The Secretary, for purposes of the VA Group Health Plan, 
shall waive any period applicable to a preexisting condition for 
similar benefits with respect to an individual to the extent that the 
individual, before the date of such individual's enrollment in such 
plan, was covered for the condition under any other health plan that 
was in effect before such date. ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall no longer apply if there is a continuous 
period of more than 60 days (or, in the case of an individual who loses

SEC."
14,,,"(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the increasingly litigious nature of the legal 
        profession in the United States has created an unnecessary and 
        ultimately harmful barrier between the traditional desire of 
        individuals to help other individuals and their ability to act 
        on those desires;
            (2) the cost of lawsuits, excessive, unpredictable, and 
        often arbitrary damage awards, and unfair allocations of 
        liability have a direct and chilling effect on the spirit of 
        volunteerism and the provision of charitable service in the 
        United States;
            (3) arbitrary and capricious damage awards against 
        volunteers and charitable institutions have contributed 
        considerably to the high cost of liability insurance, making it 
        difficult and often impossible for volunteers and volunteer 
        service organizations to be protected from liability as those 
        volunteers and many volunteer service organizations serve the 
        public without regard to receiving any personal or 
        institutional economic benefits from that service;
            (4) as a result, volunteer service organizations throughout 
        the United States have been adversely affected and often 
        debilitated as volunteers have refused to help because of a 
        fear of frivolous lawsuits;
            (5) without a resurgence in volunteerism, the essential 
        services that volunteer service organizations provide, 
        including crisis counseling, volunteer rescue services, coaches 
        and referees for sports activities of children, and support for 
        the elderly, will continue to diminish;
            (6) clarifying and limiting the personal liability risks 
        assumed by individuals and institutions who volunteer to help 
        others without benefit to themselves is an appropriate subject 
        for Federal legislation because--
                    (A) of the national scope of the problems created 
                by the legitimate fears of volunteers about frivolous, 
                arbitrary, or capricious lawsuits; and
                    (B) the citizens of the United States depend on, 
                and the Federal Government expends funds on, numerous 
                social programs that depend on the services of 
                volunteers; and
                    (C) it is in the interest of the Federal Government 
                to encourage the continued operation of volunteer 
                service organizations and contributions of volunteers 
                because the Federal Government lacks the capacity to 
                carry out all of the services provided by such 
                organizations and volunteers; and
            (7) liability reform for volunteer service organizations 
        will promote the free flow of goods and services, lessen 
        burdens on interstate commerce and uphold constitutionally 
        protected due process rights and that liability reform is thus 
        an appropriate use of the powers contained in article I, 
        section 8, clause 3 of the United States Constitution, and the 
        fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide protection 
from personal financial liability for volunteers and volunteer service 
organizations that provide volunteer services that are conducted in 
good faith--
            (1) to promote the interests of social service program 
        beneficiaries and taxpayers; and
            (2) to sustain the availability of programs, volunteer 
        service organizations, and governmental entities that depend on 
        volunteer contributions and services; and
            (3) to provide the protection by--
                    (A) placing reasonable limits on punitive damages;
                    (B) ensuring the fair allocation of liability in 
                certain civil actions; and
                    (C) establishing greater fairness, rationality, and 
                predictability in the civil justice system of the 
                United States. In general.--The term ``claimant'' means any 
                person who asserts a claim for damages in an action 
                covered by this Act and any person on whose behalf such 
                a claim is asserted. (3) Compensatory damages.--The term ``compensatory 
        damages'' means damages awarded for economic and noneconomic 
        loss. (9) Punitive damages.--The term ``punitive damages'' means 
        damages awarded against any person to punish or deter that 
        person or any other person, from engaging in similar behavior 
        in the future. (a) In General.--
            (1) Covered claims.--Subject to paragraph (2), this Act 
        governs any claim for damages in any civil action brought in 
        any State or Federal court in any case in which the claim 
        relates to--
                    (A) volunteer services performed by the defendant 
                for a governmental entity or a volunteer service 
                organization; or
                    (B) activities or services performed by a volunteer 
                service organization. (2) Actions excluded.--The limitations on damages contained 
        in this Act shall not apply in any action described in 
        subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) in any case in which--
                    (A) the misconduct for which damages are awarded --
                            (i) constitutes a crime of violence (as 
                        that term is defined in section 16 of title 18, 
                        United States Code) or an act of international 
                        terrorism (as that term is defined in section 
                        2331(1) of title 18, United States Code) for 
                        which the defendant has been convicted in any 
                        court;
                            (ii) constitutes a hate crime (as that term 
                        is used in the Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 
                        U.S.C. 534 note)) for which the defendant has 
                        been convicted in any court;
                            (iii) involves a sexual offense, as defined 
                        by applicable State law, for which the 
                        defendant has been convicted in any court; or
                            (iv) involves misconduct for which the 
                        defendant has been found to have violated a 
                        Federal or State civil rights law for which the 
                        defendant has been convicted in any court; or
                    (B) the defendant was found to be under the 
                influence (as determined pursuant to applicable State 
                law) of intoxicating alcohol or any drug, at the time 
                of the misconduct for which damages are awarded and 
                such influence was a proximate cause of the harm that 
                is the subject of the action. (c) Effect on Other Law.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed 
to--
            (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity 
        asserted by any State under any law;
            (2) supersede or alter any other Federal law;
            (3) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity 
        asserted by the United States;
            (4) affect the applicability of any provision of chapter 97 
        of title 28, United States Code;
            (5) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to 
        claims brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of a foreign 
        nation;
            (6) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to 
        apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim of a 
        foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the 
        ground of inconvenient forum; or
            (7) supersede or modify any statutory or common law, 
        including any law providing for an action to abate a nuisance, 
        that authorizes a person to institute an action for civil 
damages or civil penalties, cleanup costs, injunctions, restitution, 
cost recovery, punitive damages, or any other form of relief for 
remediation of the environment (as defined in section 101(8) of the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601(8)). SEC. 5. UNIFORM STANDARD FOR AWARD OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES. Punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by applicable State 
or Federal law, be awarded against a defendant if the claimant 
establishes by clear and convincing evidence that conduct carried out 
by the defendant with a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights 
or safety of others was the proximate cause of the harm that is the 
subject of the action in any civil action for a claim described in 
subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 4(a)(1). The amount of punitive damages that may be awarded in an action 
described in section 5 shall not exceed the lesser of--
            (1) twice the sum of the amounts awarded to the claimant 
        for economic loss and noneconomic loss; or
            (2) $250,000.

SEC. (a) In General.--This Act does not--
            (1) create a cause of action for punitive or compensatory 
        damages; or
            (2) preempt or supersede any State or Federal law to the 
        extent that such law further limits the amount of an award of 
        punitive or compensatory damages. (a) In General.--At the request of any party the trier of fact, in 
any action for punitive damages that is subject to this Act, shall 
consider in a separate proceeding, held subsequent to the determination 
of the amount of compensatory damages, whether punitive damages are to 
be awarded for the harm that is the subject of the action and the 
amount of the award. (b) Inadmissibility of Evidence Relevant Only to a Claim of 
Punitive Damages in a Proceeding Concerning Compensatory Damages.--If 
any party requests a separate proceeding under subsection (a), in a 
proceeding to determine whether the claimant may be awarded 
compensatory damages, any evidence, argument, or contention that is 
relevant only to the claim of punitive damages, as determined by 
applicable State law, shall be inadmissible. (a) General Rule.--In any action described in subparagraph (A) or 
(B) of section 4(a)(1) brought against more than one defendant, the 
liability of each defendant for compensatory damages shall be 
determined in accordance with this section. (b) Amount of Liability for Compensatory Damages.--
            (1) In general.--Each defendant shall be liable only for 
        the amount of compensatory damages allocated by the trier of 
        fact to the defendant in direct proportion to the percentage of 
        responsibility of the defendant (determined in accordance with 
        paragraph (2)) for the harm to the claimant with respect to 
        which the defendant is found to be liable. (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of 
        determining the amount of compensatory damages allocated to a 
        defendant under this section, the trier of fact in an action 
        described in subsection (a) shall determine the percentage of 
        responsibility of each person responsible for the harm to the 
        claimant, without regard to whether that person is party to the 
        action."

17,,,"Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The inappropriate display of social security account 
        numbers has contributed to a growing range of illegal 
        activities, including fraud, identity theft, stalking, and 
        other crimes that have a substantial effect on interstate 
        commerce and public safety. (2) The Federal Government requires virtually every 
        individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a social 
        security account number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for 
        old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits under 
        title II of the Social Security Act, or to seek employment. 3. PROHIBITION ON THE DISPLAY TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC ON THE 
              INTERNET OF THE LAST 4 DIGITS OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT 
              NUMBERS BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. (a) In General.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended by

    ``(a) In General.--A State, a political subdivision of a State, or 
any officer, employee, or contractor of a State or a political 
subdivision of a State, shall not display to the general public on the 
Internet the last 4 digits of any social security account number. ``(b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to supersede, alter, or affect any restriction or limitation 
on the display to the general public on the Internet of all, or any 
part of, social security account numbers provided for in any Federal or 
State statute, regulation, order, or interpretation, if the restriction

or redact the last 4 digits of social security account numbers from 
forms and records of executive, legislative, and judicial agencies of 
States and political subdivisions of States that, as of the date of 
enactment of this Act, have been displayed to the general public on the

            (1) In general.--The term ``nonqualified real property 
        interest'' means, with respect to any exempt REIT, any interest

                    (B) Leases.--Such term shall not include any lease 
                of a qualified real property interest. (4) Treatment of entities which are not stapled, etc. on

        section, all interests in real property held by an exempt REIT 
        or any stapled entity with respect to such REIT (or treated 
        under subsection (c) as held by such REIT or stapled entity) 
        shall be treated as nonqualified real property interests 
        unless--
                    (A) such stapled entity was a stapled entity with 
                respect to such REIT as of March 26, 1998, and at all

        entity of the exempt REIT or stapled entity, as the case may 
        be. In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), any interest in real property held by a 10-percent 
                subsidiary entity of an exempt REIT or stapled entity 
                shall be treated as a nonqualified real property 
                interest. (B) Exception for interests in real property held 
                on march 26, 1998, etc.--In the case of an entity which

                stapled entity on March 26, 1998, and at all times 
                thereafter, an interest in real property held by such 
                subsidiary entity shall be treated as a qualified real 
                property interest if such interest would be so treated 
                if held directly by the exempt REIT or the stapled 
                entity. (3) Reduction in qualified real property interests if 
        increase in ownership of subsidiary.--If, after March 26, 1998, 
        an exempt REIT or stapled entity increases its ownership 
        interest in a subsidiary entity to which paragraph (2)(B) 
        applies above its ownership interest in such subsidiary entity 
        as of such date, the additional portion of each interest in 
        real property which is treated as held by the exempt REIT or 
        stapled entity by reason of such increased ownership shall be 
        treated as a nonqualified real property interest. (4) Special rules for determining ownership.--For purposes 
        of this subsection--
                    (A) percentage ownership of an entity shall be 
                determined in accordance with subsection (e)(4),

                the exempt REIT or stapled entity in any acquisition 
                described in an agreement, announcement, or filing 
                described in subsection (b)(2) shall be treated as 
                acquired on March 26, 1998, and
                    (C) except as provided in guidance prescribed by 
                the Secretary, any change in proportionate ownership 
                which is attributable solely to fluctuations in the 
                relative fair market values of different classes of 
                stock shall not be taken into account. In general.--In the case of any nonqualified obligation 
        held by an exempt REIT or any member of the stapled REIT group, 
        the REIT gross income provisions shall be applied by treating 
        the exempt REIT as having impermissible tenant service income 
        equal to--
                    (A) the interest income from such obligation which 
                is properly allocable to the property described in 
                paragraph (2), and

                respect to such property. (2) Nonqualified obligation.--Except as otherwise provided 
        in this subsection, the term ``nonqualified obligation'' means 
        any obligation secured by a mortgage on an interest in real 
        property if the income of any member of the stapled REIT group 
        for services furnished with respect to such property would be 
        impermissible tenant service income were such property held by 
        the exempt REIT and such services furnished by the exempt REIT. (4) Exception for existing obligations.--Such term shall 
        not include any obligation--
                    (A) which is secured on March 26, 1998, by an 
                interest in real property, and
                    (B) which is held on such date by the exempt REIT 
                or any entity which is a member of the stapled REIT 
                group on such date and at all times thereafter,
        but only so long as such obligation is secured by such 
        interest. In general.--The term ``10-percent subsidiary 
                entity'' means, with respect to any exempt REIT or 
                stapled entity, any entity in which the exempt REIT or 
                stapled entity (as the case may be) directly or 
                indirectly holds at least a 10-percent interest."

26,,,"Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) From 2014 through 2018, the United States and nations 
        around the world will mark the centennial of World War I, 
        including the entry of the United States into the war in April 
        1917. (7) Commemorative programs, activities, and sites allow 
        people in the United States to learn about the history of World 
        War I, the United States involvement in that war, and the war's 
        effects on the remainder of the 20th century, and to 
        commemorate and honor the participation of the United States 
        and its citizens in the war effort. (8) While the other great conflicts of the 20th century, 
        World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, have 
        national memorials on the Mall in Washington, DC, there 
        currently exists no nationally recognized memorial honoring the 
        service of the United States and its citizens in World War I.
            (9) In 1921, the people of Kansas City, Missouri dedicated 
        a site in that city for a memorial to the service of Americans 
        in World War I, a ceremony attended by General John J. Pershing 
        and military leaders of Great Britain, France, Belgium, and 
        Italy. The 108th Congress designated the museum at the base 
        of the Liberty Memorial as ``America's National World War I 
        Museum''. (13) The DC War Memorial is located on the national Mall in 
        Washington, adjacent to the World War II, Korean War, and 
        Vietnam memorials. Of these memorials, which now compose a 
        quartet of memorials to the 4 great wars of the American 
        Century, only the DC War Memorial is not a national memorial.

SEC. (a)  Designation of the National World War I Museum and Memorial, 
Missouri.--
            (1) In general.--The Liberty Memorial of Kansas City at the 
        America's National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, 
        is designated as the ``National World War I Museum and 
        Memorial''. (2) Ceremonies.--The Commission may plan, develop, and 
        execute ceremonies to rededicate the Liberty Memorial of Kansas 
        City as the National World War I Museum and Memorial. (b) Designation of the District of Columbia and National World War 
I Memorial.--
            (1) Designation.--The District of Columbia War Memorial in 
        Washington, DC, is designated as the ``District of Columbia and 
        National World War I Memorial''. (2) Ceremonies.--The Commission may plan, develop, and 
        execute ceremonies to rededicate the District of Columbia War 
        Memorial as the District of Columbia and National World War I 
        Memorial. In general.--The World War I Memorial 
                Foundation may establish a commemorative work at the 
                site of the District of Columbia and National World War 
                I Memorial consisting of an appropriate sculptural or 
                other commemorative element reflecting the national 
                character of the memorial. (B) Requirements.--Any commemorative work 
                established under subparagraph (A) shall complement and 
                preserve the memorial (including the landscape of the 
                memorial), as in existence on the date of enactment of 
                this Act. In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the 
                rededication of the District of Columbia and National 
                World War I Memorial shall be in accordance with 
                chapter 89 of title 40, United States Code. (B) Congressional finding.--Congress finds that 
                because this Act authorizes the rededication and 
                related enhancement of a commemorative work that, as of 
                the date of enactment of this Act, is in existence and 
                is sited within the Reserve (as defined in section 
                8902(a)(3) of title 40, United States Code), the 
                provisions regarding site approval and location of 
                commemorative works under sections 8905 and 8908(c) of 
                title 40, United States Code, do not apply to this Act. (5) Deposit of excess funds.--The World War I Memorial 
        Foundation shall transmit to the Secretary of the Treasury for 
        deposit in the account provided for in section 8906(b)(3) of 
        title 40, United States Code--
                    (A) any funds that remain after payment of all

                (including payment of the amount for maintenance and 
                preservation required under section 8906(b) of that 
                title); or
                    (B) any funds that remain for the commemorative 
                work authorized under subsection (a) on expiration of 
                the authority for the commemorative work under section 
                8903(e) of that title.

28,,,"(2) Virtually every State in the country is facing a 
        substitute teacher shortage, a problem that has been 
        exacerbated by increased demand for professional development 
        opportunities for teachers. (3) In 73 percent of school districts, there is an 
        immediate, urgent need for substitute teachers. (5) This shortage is likely to grow to a crisis level 
        within the next 10 years, as an acute shortage of substitute 
        teachers develops because an unprecedented number of children 
        will enter our schools. (6) The substitute teacher shortage has lead schools to 
        relax their requirements and hire substitute teachers that are 
        often underqualified. (8) Nearly 12 percent of districts do not require 
        substitute teachers to fill out a job application. In 30 percent of all school districts, no background 
        checks are conducted on applicants for substitute teaching 
        positions, and only half the districts check applicants' 
        references.
            (11) Poorly trained substitute teachers have a negative 
        impact on student academic performance. Nine out of the ten lowest-ranked States in National Assessment 
        of Educational Progress (NAEP) testing allowed substitute 
        teachers with only a high school diploma to teach in their 
        schools. (13) Of the top 25 States in education spending, 9 require 
        at least a college degree for substitute teachers. In 77 percent of school districts across the country, 
        substitute teachers are given no training at all. (15) Alleviating the substitute teacher crisis would free 
        up precious time for other teachers to spend in professional 
        development programs.

SEC. Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of 
Education shall establish a competitive demonstration grant program to 
provide grants for a single academic year directly to not fewer than 50 
nor more than 100 local educational agencies (as that term is defined 
in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965), 
or to regional consortia of such agencies acting together, that vary 
geographically and socioeconomically, to enable such agencies or 
consortia to experiment with ways to alleviate the substitute teacher 
shortage described in section 2.

SEC. In selecting grant recipients under section 3, the Secretary of 
Education shall select applicants that, collectively, will explore a 
range of options for addressing the substitute teacher shortage, such 
as--
            (1) developing a public relations campaign targeted at 
        likely substitute teacher candidates (such as retired 
        teachers);
            (2) establishing permanent substitute teacher pools;
            (3) addressing issues that hinder the ability of 
        administrators to find qualified substitute teachers; or
            (4) increasing the availability of content and skills 
        training for substitute teachers.

SEC. Not later than 1 year after the date the last grant made under 
section 3 expires, the Secretary of Education shall submit a report to 
the Congress describing the findings and results of the demonstration 
program under this Act, including--
            (1) the programs or methods that best alleviated the 
        substitute teacher shortage, and where those programs or 
        methods worked best; and
            (2) the impact of economic conditions on the quality and 
        availability of substitute teachers."
29,,,"Congress finds the following:
            (1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain 
        undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to 
        wildlife management, and nothing in this Act interferes with or 
        otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing 
        wildlife generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring the 
        incidence of chronic wasting disease. (2) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neurological disease 
        found in cervids, is a fundamental threat to the health and 
        vibrancy of deer and elk populations, and the increased 
        occurrence of chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse 
        locations in recent months necessitates an escalation in 
        research, surveillance, monitoring, and management activities 
        focused on containing, managing, and eradicating this lethal 
        disease. (3) As the States move to manage existing incidence of 
        chronic wasting disease and insulate non-infected wild and 
        captive cervid populations from the disease, the Federal 
        Government should endeavor to provide integrated and holistic 
        financial and technical support to these States. In its statutory role as supporting agent, relevant 
        Federal agencies should provide consistent, coherent, and 
        integrated support structures and programs for the benefit of 
        State wildlife and agricultural administrators, as chronic 
        wasting disease can move freely between captive and wild 
        cervids across the broad array of Federal, State, and local 
        land management jurisdictions. (a) Modeling Program Required.--The Secretary of the Interior shall 
establish a modeling program to predict the spread of chronic wasting 
disease in wild deer and elk in the United States. SURVEILLANCE AND MONITORING PROGRAM REGARDING PRESENCE OF 
              CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE IN WILD HERDS OF DEER AND ELK.

    (a) Program Development.--Using existing authorities, the Secretary 
of the Interior, acting through the United States Geological Survey, 
shall conduct a surveillance and monitoring program on Federal lands 
managed by the Secretary to identify--
            (1) the incidence of chronic wasting disease infection in 
        wild herds of deer and elk;
            (2) the cause and extent of the spread of the disease; and
            (3) potential reservoirs of infection and vectors promoting 
        the spread of the disease. (b) Tribal Assistance.--In developing the surveillance and 
monitoring program for wild herds on Federal lands, the Secretary of 
the Interior shall provide assistance to tribal governments or tribal 
government entities responsible for managing and controlling chronic 
wasting disease in wildlife on tribal lands. (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior $3,000,000 to establish 
and support the surveillance and monitoring program. (a) Information Repository.--The United States Department of 
Agriculture, using existing authorities, shall develop and maintain an 
interactive, Internet-based web site that displays--
            (1) surveillance and monitoring program data regarding 
        chronic wasting disease in both wild and captive cervid 
        populations and other wildlife that are collected by the 
        Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, 
        other Federal agencies, and State agencies assisted under this 
        Act;
            (2) modeling information regarding the spread of chronic 
        wasting disease in the United States; and
            (3) other relevant information regarding chronic wasting 
        disease received from other sources. (b) Information Sharing Policy.--The national repository shall be 
available as a resource for Federal and State agencies responsible for 
managing and controlling chronic wasting disease and for institutions 
of higher education and other public or private research entities 
conducting research regarding chronic wasting disease. (a) Sampling Protocol.--Within 30 days of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Agriculture shall release guidelines for the use by 
Federal, State, tribal and local agencies for the collection of animal 
tissue to be tested for chronic wasting disease. (b) Testing Protocol.--Within 30 days of enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of Agriculture shall release a protocol to be used in the 
laboratory assessment of samples of animal tissue that may be 
contaminated with chronic wasting disease. (c) Laboratory Certification.--Within 45 days of enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall develop a program for the 
inspection and certification of Federal and non-Federal laboratories 
conducting chronic wasting disease tests. ERADICATION OF CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE IN HERDS OF DEER AND 
              ELK.

    (a) Captive Herd Program Development.--The Secretary of 
Agriculture, acting through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, shall develop a program to identify the rate of chronic 
wasting disease infection in captive herds of deer and elk, the cause 
and extent of the spread of the disease, and potential reservoirs of 
infection and vectors promoting the spread of the disease. (2) Cooperation.--In developing the surveillance and 
        monitoring program for captive herds, the Secretary of 
        Agriculture shall cooperate with State agencies responsible for

                        sanctioned person is a sole source supplier of 
                        such articles or services, that such articles

Jurisdiction.--
            (1) Consultations.--If the President makes a determination 
        described in subsection (a) with respect to a foreign person, 
        the Congress urges the President to initiate consultations 
        immediately with the government with primary jurisdiction over 
        that foreign person with respect to the imposition of sanctions

        the President determines and certifies to the Congress that the 
        continued imposition of that sanction with respect to that 
        person would have a serious adverse effect on vital United 
        States interests. (3) Violating united nations sanctions.--The term 
        ``violating United Nations sanctions''--

                country, means failing to apply measures called for by 
                the United Nations Security Council; and
                    (B) in the case of person, means engaging in 
                activities that are prohibited under United Nations 
                sanctions, without regard to whether the foreign 
                government with primary jurisdiction over those 
                activities has applied the measures called for by the 
                United Nations Security Council."

        United Nations for such fiscal year. (b) Certification.--The certification referred to in subsection (a) 
is a certification made by the President to Congress that--
            (1) the United Nations has in effect procedures that 
        provide the General Accounting Office access to all documents 
        relating to the oil-for-food program so that the Comptroller 
        General may perform nationally mandated reviews of United 
        Nations operations;
            (2) the United Nations Secretary General has formally 
        confirmed that the United Nations will not assert the 
        inviolability of United Nations papers and internal records 
        that concern the oil-for-food program or a sanction imposed on 
        Iraq related to the oil-for-food program;
            (3) the United Nations Secretary General has authorized the 
        release to the law enforcement authorities of any member state 
        of the United Nations authentic copies of any document in the 
        possession of the United Nations, including any document in the 
        possession of a person who was engaged on a contract basis to 
        provide goods or services to the United Nations, that in the 
        judgment of the requesting authority directly or indirectly 
        concerns the oil-for-food program or a sanction imposed on Iraq 
        related to the oil-for-food program upon request by such law 
        enforcement authority;
            (4) the United Nations has waived any immunity enjoyed by 
        any United Nations official from the judicial process in the 
        United States for any civil or criminal acts or omissions under 
        Federal or State law that may have transpired within the 
        jurisdiction of the United States in connection with the oil-
        for-food program; and
            (5) any United Nations official who benefitted financially 
        from the oil-for-food program has reimbursed the Government of 
        Iraq and any other entity affected by the illicit activity of 
        such official the full amount that such official improperly 
        received from the oil-for-food program."

                consider the extent to which reliance on postmarket

person to support an approval of an application. ``(iii) Any clinical data, including 1 or more well-controlled 
investigations, specified by the Secretary for demonstrating a 
reasonable assurance of device effectiveness shall reflect the 
Secretary's determination that such data are necessary to establish 
device effectiveness and that no other less burdensome means of 
evaluating device effectiveness are available which would have a 
reasonable likelihood of resulting in an approval. ``(2) The determination of the Secretary with respect to the 
specification of the valid scientific evidence under clause (ii) shall 
be binding upon the Secretary, unless such determination by the 
Secretary would be contrary to the public health''; and
            (3) in subsection (i), by adding at the end the following:

43,,,"(2) To address the shortage of qualified nurses, schools of 
        nursing have developed accelerated, second-baccalaureate degree 
        programs in nursing. According to the American

is amended by inserting ``(including an accelerated nursing degree 
program)'' before ``and including''.

SEC. Section 811(f)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
296j(f)(2)) is amended by striking the period at the end and inserting 
``, except in the case of a nurse faculty shortage, the Secretary may,
